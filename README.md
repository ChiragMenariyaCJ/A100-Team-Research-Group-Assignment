# 1. Introduction

## 1.1.	Problem statement and research motivation (100 words)

Road traffic crashes are a leading public health and development challenge in Jamaica, with hundreds of fatalities reported annually. This study asks whether towns and cities in Jamaica’s northern and southern regions differ in mean crash counts, aiming to reveal geographic disparities that current national summaries do not fully break down. Identifying regional differences can pinpoint high-risk areas and inform targeted infrastructure, enforcement, and education policies. Using island-wide crash records segmented by parish and town will allow robust statistical comparison and guide resource allocation to reduce injuries and fatalities across Jamaica’s varied transport routes. The analysis will support evidence-based policy decisions (Pan American Health Organization, 2024).

## 1.2.	The data set (75 words)

The dataset contains yearly records of road traffic crashes across towns and cities in Jamaica, including variables such as Year, City, Number_of_Crashes, and Region_in_Jamaica (North, South, Unknown, External). It provides a detailed view of crash distribution between 2007 and 2015, allowing comparison of crash frequencies across regions. This structure enables statistical analysis, such as comparing mean crashes between northern and southern areas, to identify area-based patterns, assess regional risk, and guide targeted road-safety measures.

## 1.3.	Research question (50 words). 
Is there a difference in the mean of the crashes between towns /cities of the northern part & southern part of Jamaica?

## 1.4.	Null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis (H₀/H₁) 
For this study, the null hypothesis (H₀) states that there is no difference in the mean number of road traffic crashes between towns and cities in the northern and southern regions of Jamaica. In formal terms: 
```
H₀: µNorth = µSouth
```
The alternative hypothesis (H₁) proposes that there is a difference in the mean crash counts between the two regions, indicating possible regional variability: 
```
H₁: µNorth ≠ µSouth
```
These hypotheses directly address the research question by testing whether regional crash patterns differ significantly.
